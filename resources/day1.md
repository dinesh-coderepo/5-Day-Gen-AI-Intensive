💡 What You’ll Learn

Today you’ll explore the evolution of LLMs, from transformers to techniques like fine-tuning and inference acceleration. You’ll also get trained in the art of prompt engineering for optimal LLM interaction and evaluating LLMs. 

The first codelab will walk you through getting started with the Gemini 2.0 API and cover several prompt techniques including how different parameters impact the prompts. In the second codelab, you will also learn how to evaluate the response of LLMs using autoraters and structured output.

📋 Reminders

Tomorrow at 11:00 AM PT,  Paige Bailey is hosting the first livestream on our YouTube channel to discuss the assignments with the course authors and other special guests from Google. Tomorrow’s guests are Warren Barkley, Logan Kilpatrick, Kieran Milan, Anant Nawalgaria, Irina Sigler and Mat Velloso.
Discord is the best place to ask questions – specifically in the #5dgai-question-forum channel. In addition to other participants, several Googlers are there to help. During the livestream, we'll also pick some questions from Discord to discuss. You'll get Kaggle swag if your question is chosen!
We also have a troubleshooting guide for the codelabs. Be sure to check there for solutions to common problems.
We want this course community to be positive and supportive. Please follow Kaggle’s community guidelines found here.
Happy learning and see you tomorrow!
